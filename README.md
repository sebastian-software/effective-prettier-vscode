# ✪ Effective Prettier - Formatter for Visual Studio Code

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

While Prettier is fine this is even better: This extension makes use of [Effective Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@effective/prettier) to combine ESLint with Prettier. It executes both in one process and saves the combined result. This allows to fine-tune the changes made by Prettier or apply additional auto-fixable rules to your code e.g. sorting and grouping of imports, syncing JSDoc comments, reworking code to preferred modern approaches (e.g. usage of const, spreading, destructing, ...).

## Installation

Install through VS Code extensions. Search for `Effective Prettier`

[Visual Studio Code Market Place: Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sebastian-software.effective-prettier-vscode)

Can also be installed in VS Code: Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P), paste the following command, and press enter.

```
ext install sebastian-software.effective-prettier-vscode
```

### Default Formatter

To ensure that this extension is used over other extensions you may have installed, be sure to set it as the default formatter in your VS Code settings. This setting can be set for all languages or by a specific language.

```json
{
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "sebastian-software.effective-prettier-vscode"
}
```

### @Effective/Prettier Resolution

This extension will use the tools installed in your project's local dependencies. As this extension is basically an integration of Effective-Prettier into VSCode you have to install that tool into your local JavaScript application.

To install it in your project run:

```
npm install @effective/prettier -D
```

## Configuration

It is recommended that you always include a [Prettier Configuration file](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html) in your project specifying all settings for your project. This will ensure that no matter how you run prettier - from this extension, from the CLI, or from another IDE with Prettier, the same settings will get applied.

Options are searched recursively down from the file being formatted so if you want to apply prettier settings to your entire project simply set a configuration in the root.

## Usage

### Using Command Palette (CMD/CTRL + Shift + P)

```
1. CMD + Shift + P -> Format Document
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Visual Studio Code provides [default keyboard shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keyboard-shortcuts-reference) for code formatting. You can learn about these for each platform in the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keyboard-shortcuts-reference).

If you don't like the defaults, you can rebind `editor.action.formatDocument` and `editor.action.formatSelection` in the keyboard shortcuts menu of vscode.

### Format On Save

Respects `editor.formatOnSave` setting.

You can turn on format-on-save on a per-language basis by scoping the setting:

```json
// Set the default
"editor.formatOnSave": false
```
